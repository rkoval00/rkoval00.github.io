## Metro Area COVID Dashboard - April 2022

**Project description:** For this project, I set out to create a dashboard to allow users to visualize which metro areas fared better or worse over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic was not over as of the time this project was completed, it came at a time when most of the official policies intended to combat the pandemic were over.
