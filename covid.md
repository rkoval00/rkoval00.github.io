## Metro Area COVID Dashboard - April 2022

**Project description:** 

For this project, I set out to create a dashboard to allow users to visualize which metro areas fared better or worse over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic was not over as of the time this project was completed, it came at a time when most of the official policies intended to combat the pandemic were over. 

To make the dashboard useful, I made sure to include multiple visuals, each of which illustrate different things. Interactivity was also included as a way to allow the user to make better use of the visualizations. The map of the U.S. allows the reader to see which overall areas of the country saw more deaths overall. For example, the Southeast in general saw more deaths per capita than New England. The boxplot allows the reader to see each metro area's deaths per capita relative to other metro areas in a way the color in the map alone cannot illustrate. Clicking on a metro area on the map will also highlight its place in the boxplot, enabling the reader to see its overall relation to the rest of the country and the median deaths per capita. A line chart at the bottom also allows the reader to see the overall trend in deaths over time, with the search bar allowing the user to select a metro area to look at over time.
